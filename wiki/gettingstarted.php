                    Wheelspire is a project website designed to showcase 20+ different products to users, each with two available options. Users can
                    create an account, add products to their cart, place orders and edit their profile. With an interactive admin page in the background, any account with admin
                    privileges can access the admin page. No programming expeirence is required, the admin page was designed to give non-programmers an easy expeirence to manage their website.
                    <br><br>
                     If you’re customizing the site, all product data is stored in a database file, and can be edited through the admin page. Making it easy to add or 
                    update products without touching the core code. All you need is an image and product information.
